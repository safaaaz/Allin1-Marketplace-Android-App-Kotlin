# ALLIN1 - Small Business Marketplace App

**Overview**  
Small businesses play a crucial role in the economy by adding more net new jobs than large enterprises. However, only 50% of these businesses survive, largely due to expensive marketing methods that exceed their income. To support and empower small business owners, we developed **ALLIN1**, an Android application that streamlines the advertising process, reduces costs, and provides an additional income source for aspiring entrepreneurs.

**ALLIN1** offers a seamless shopping experience for customers by bringing together various businesses and their products into one easy-to-use platform. This local application, designed for businesses in Israel, allows owners to register and showcase their offerings with all relevant details, including price ranges, promotions, and shipping costs.
