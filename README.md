Small businesses play a vital and positive role in the country's economy, as they add more net new jobs than large businesses. In contrast, it was found that only 50% of these businesses survive. One of the main reasons for this is the marketing methods that cost a lot of money in relation to the income of the business.
Here comes our turn, how to help and encourage small business owners to continue? For this purpose, we thought and developed an ALLIN1 application that collects all kinds of businesses, and helps the business owners advertise their work as easily and quickly as possible with less cost, also adding a source of income for anyone interested in opening a small business, in addition to making an easy shopping experience for the customer through building an application that meets All his needs.
ALLIN1 - a local application that allows business owners in Israel to register and present the works or a variety of products offered to the customer, thus we collect all the sales business together with the service business. With each product preview or service example, we add all the information including price range, promotions and shipping cost. In addition, the application is designed for all types of businesses with a low cost compared to what is found today, and more functionality such as product rating, shopping basket, comments, etc...

The application was found to be an effective tool that can be improved at any time, add more functionality according to the users' response, and change requirements if necessary.

We have 2 users:
